# 🚀 Pwn College Write-Ups Repository

Welcome to my **CTF Write-Ups Repository**! This is where I document my journey through various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, focusing on binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and other cybersecurity techniques. The repository is organized by [Pwn College](https://pwn.college/) courses, serving as a knowledge base for myself and others interested in offensive security.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each directory corresponds to a **Pwn College course/module**, containing detailed write-ups for its challenges. Example structure:
pwn-write-ups/
├───Linux-luminarium/ # Write-ups for Linux basics
└───... # More to come!

---

## ✨ Why This Repository?
- **📝 Learning Log**: Track my progress and reinforce concepts.
- **🔍 Reference**: Detailed explanations of techniques (e.g., manpage, file globbing, etc).
- **🌍 Sharing**: Help others learn from solved challenges.
- **🏆 CTF Prep**: Archive of tricks and tools for future competitions.

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Covered
- **Binary Exploitation**: Buffer overflows, format strings, shellcoding.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Ghidra, IDA Pro, dynamic analysis.
- **Web/Pwn**: SQLi, XSS, privilege escalation.
- **Cryptography**: RSA, AES, side-channel attacks.

---

## 📝 How to Use
1. Navigate to the relevant course folder.
2. Find the challenge name (e.g., `stack_buffer_overflow.md`).
3. Read the write-up for:
   - **Vulnerability analysis**

### ❌ What’s Not Included (Yet!):
- **Full Exploit Code**:  
  I’m still learning exploitation techniques, so finished PoCs (Proof of Concepts) aren’t provided.  
- **Mitigation Strategies**:  
  Solutions to patch the vulnerabilities aren’t covered (but might be added later!).  

*Why?* This approach helps me deeply understand vulnerabilities first, before jumping to exploits. As I progress, I’ll expand the scope!  

*Want to help?* PRs with exploit examples or fixes are welcome! 🙌

## 🤝 Contributions
Feel free to:
- **Open issues** for questions/suggestions.
- **Submit PRs** to correct mistakes or add insights.
- **Star the repo** if you find it useful! ⭐

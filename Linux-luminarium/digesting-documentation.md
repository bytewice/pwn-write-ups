# Searching for Manuals - Write-Up

## üåü Overview
**Challenge:** [Searching for Manuals]()  
**Category:** Documentation Digging  
**Description:**  
> [Your task is to locate the specific manpage containing the command that will display the flag. Unlike previous challenges where the command name was intuitive (like `flag` or `print_flag`), this time the command name has been *randomized* - requiring more thorough documentation searching skills.]

## üîç Problem Analysis

- What made this challenge tricky or interesting?

To successfully solve this challenge, you'll need to combine fundamental documentation navigation skills with knowledge gained from all previous Pwn College dojo exercises. This builds progressively on the concepts covered in earlier modules.
- ```man -k flag```

HINT 1: man man teaches you advanced usage of the man command itself, and you must use this knowledge to figure out how to search for the hidden manpage that will tell you how to use /challenge/challenge

HINT 2: though the man page is randomly named, you still actually use /challenge/challenge to get the flag!

And I found this problem interesting because it was the first to require a little bit of independency in the search, I was excited when I managed to solve it :D
